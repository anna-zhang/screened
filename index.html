            The internet was once hailed as the great equalizerâ€”a boundless space for free expression, knowledge, and global connection. It was imagined as a realm where borders dissolved, voices multiplied, and ideas flowed freely. Yet, the reality of the internet today is far from its utopian origins, shaped instead by governments, corporations, and algorithms that limit what we can see, say, and do online.

            <i>Screened</i> explores these layers of control through an interactive experience. The title plays on the dual meaning of "screen" as both the tool we use to access the internet and a metaphorical filter that limits our view. Through visual obstructions and distortions, Screened invites participants to feel the impact of censorship and control, raising urgent questions about the fragility of internet freedom and its role in shaping our digital lives.

        <p>
          Access to the internet is shaped by infrastructure, affordability, and government restrictions. 
          In some regions, these barriers are extreme, limiting connectivity for millions.
