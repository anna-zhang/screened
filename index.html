        <p>
            The internet was once hailed as the great equalizerâ€”a boundless space for free expression, knowledge, and global connection. It was imagined as a realm where borders dissolved, voices multiplied, and ideas flowed freely. Yet, the reality of the internet today is far from its utopian origins, shaped instead by governments, corporations, and algorithms that limit what we can see, say, and do online.

        <p>
            <i>Screened</i> explores these layers of control through an interactive experience. The title plays on the dual meaning of "screen" as both the tool we use to access the internet and a metaphorical filter that limits our view. Through visual obstructions and distortions, Screened invites participants to feel the impact of censorship and control, raising urgent questions about the fragility of internet freedom and its role in shaping our digital lives.

        <h2>Violation of User Rights</h2>
        <p>
            User rights are violated through restrictions on free expression, invasions of privacy, and punitive actions for online activities. Governments, corporations, and other entities employ censorship, surveillance, and targeted harassment, eroding the fundamental principles of an open and secure internet.
